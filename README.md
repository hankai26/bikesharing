# Overview
This project is to prepare a proposal of a bike-sharing  program in Des Moines for investors. The Citi bike-sharing analysis is used to support the proposal using tableau visualizations. The data of Citi Bikes in August 2019 is used in this analysis.

Here we conducted these studies as followings.
- Convert the datatype for specific columns to datetime to prepare the data for visualization analysis, using Python and Pandas functions.
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
- Indicate the August peak hour for rides.
- Indicate the top starting locations and ending locations for rides.

# Results

2. Manhattan looks likes a popular location to start and end a bike rental. It's probably due to lots of tourists.

Based on the gender for ride user, males sound like rental bikes more offen than females. However, the checkout duration looks same among males and females.
